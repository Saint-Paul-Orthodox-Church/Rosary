AN INTRODUCTION TO THE HOLY ROSARY

The Rosary is an ancient and beloved form of prayer in which we contemplate the
fifteen chief historical events up-on which our faith is founded. In praying the
Rosary, the Our Father  is said upon every large bead, and the Hail Mary upon
every small bead, with each decade, or set of ten, being ended with the Glory
be. Each decade is said in honour of some sacred mystery which is set apart for
contemplation during the prayers.

THE MANNER OF SAYING THE ROSARY

1. Holding the cross in the right hand, make the Holy Sign, saying, "In the name
of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen."
2. While still holding the cross, say the Apostlesâ€™ Creed
3. Upon the first large bead after the cross, say the Our Father. Upon each of
the next three small beads, say a Hail Mary. After the third Hail Mary, say the
Glory be upon the knot or chain.
4. Then name the mystery upon which you are to meditate first. For example, "The
Annunciation of Our Lady."
5. While contemplating this mystery, say the Our Father on the large bead just
before the medal. Then say a Hail Mary on each of the ten small beads after the
medal. After the tenth Hail Mary, say the Glory be on the knot or chain. (As an
aid to this contemplation, certain short devotional phrases may be added to each
recitation of the Hail Mary, as is described below.)
6. Now proceed to the second mystery, saying the Our Father on the large bead
and ten Hail Marys on the small beads, ending with the Glory be. Continue in
this wise until the Chaplet, or set of mysteries appointed for the day, has been
finished.
7. At the end of this set, or Chaplet, of five mysteries, recite the Salve
Regina, followed by its proper versicle and collect. This last being said, the
Rosary is ended.

THE PRAYERS OF THE ROSARY

Ghost. Amen.

***Apostles' Creed***: I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and
earth: And in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord: Who was conceived by the Holy
Ghost, Born of the Virgin Mary, Suffered under Pontius Pilate, Was crucified,
dead, and buried: He descended into hell; the third day he rose again from the
dead: He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the right hand of God the Father
Almighty: From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. I believe
in the Holy Ghost, the holy Catholic Church, the Communion of Saints, the
Forgiveness of sins, the Resurrection of the body, and the Life everlasting.
Amen.

***Our Father***: Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name. Thy
kingdom come. Thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day
our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass
against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen.

***Hail Mary***: Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art
thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother
of God, pray for us sinners, now and in the hour of our death. Amen.

R. As it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end.

THE MYSTERIES

Here follows a list of simple phrases which may, as an aid to both memory and
devotion, be added to the recitation of each Hail Mary after the Holy Name of
Jesus is said, in this wise: Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus, whom
we ask to increase our faith. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners,
now and in the hour of our death. Amen.

CONCLUSION OF THE ROSARY

*Salve Regina*: Mary, we hail thee, Mother and Queen compassionate; Mary our
comfort, life, and hope, we hail thee. To thee we exiles, children of Eve lift
our crying. To thee we are sighing, as mournful and weeping, we pass through
this vale of sorrow. Turn thou, therefore, O our intercessor, those thine eyes
of pity and loving-kindness upon us sinners. Hereafter, when our earthly exile
shall be ended, shew us Jesus, the blessed fruit of thy womb. O gentle, O
tender, O gracious Virgin Mary.

*Proper Versicle & Response*:

V. Pray for us, O holy Mother of God.

R. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

*Proper Collect*: Let us Pray. O God, whose only-begotten Son, by his life,
death, and resurrection, hath purchased for us the reward of eternal life;
grant, we beseech thee; that as we meditate upon these Mysteries in the most
holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary, we may imitate what they contain, and
obtain what they promise; through the same Christ our Lord. R. Amen.
